# Inventory_Management_App
This project is a simple inventory manager java application.

Currently there is no database connectivity and values reset to defaults on close.

Users can search, add, modify and delete parts and products from the inventory menu and products can have associated parts linked to them.

The app could be enhanced in the future by connecting it to a database that populates the tables and have the controls modify the inventory data stored in the database.
